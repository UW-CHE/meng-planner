This repo contains a streamlit app that allows MEng students in the department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo to plan their degree. It is particularly useful for planning specializations, as it ensures students have taken the correct courses to qualify for the specialization of their choosing.  

The running app is hosted on the Streamlit Cloud service.
